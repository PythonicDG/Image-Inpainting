Image Inpainting using LaMa and Stable Diffusion
ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project focuses on image inpainting â€” the task of filling missing or masked regions in an image â€” using two powerful deep learning models:

LaMa (Large Mask Inpainting with Fourier Convolutions): Fast and high-quality inpainting for large missing regions.

Stable Diffusion Inpainting: Diffusion-based approach for realistic and creative image completions.

The goal is to reconstruct missing parts of an image seamlessly while preserving structural and semantic consistency.
